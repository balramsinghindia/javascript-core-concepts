## Closure
Many JavaScript concepts, like Closure, Event loops and Generators etc., are not one-line concepts for any beginner. I suggest watching videos to see each step in action to understand them.

Understanding Closure is multi-step activity:
1. Know the definition of it.
2. See Closure in the browser console
3. know the use cases of it.


### 1. Definition:
In Simple words, Closure gives you access to the parent function's scope from an inner function. Closures are created at the time of the creation of the function.


### 2. Closure in Browser console:
Refer screenshot attached.

### 3. Usecases:
- suppose you want to count no of times a button is clicked; closure is the best choice.
- Implement Throttling and Debounce.
- Currying
- Memorize
- Maintaining state in the async world
- Functions like once
- setTimeouts
- Iterators
